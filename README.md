# Code-Quiz
My Code Quiz is a multiple choice, timed quiz application that will test anyones coding knowledge. It will be timed and the time will reflect your score that you can later save along with your initials. Using buttons to begin and choose answers, every wrong answer will deduct time from the timer until it hits 0 or you answer all the questions.

# Roadmap
I want to eventually add more questions to get a better point scale for anyone who takes the quiz, as well as make specific subjects for those who want to test their knowledge in a specific subject.
